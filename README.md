Developer's website: [https://mattmccutchen.net]
Home of the project (at developer's website): [https://mattmccutchen.net/bigint/]
Please see the original 'README' file for details.

I (gdinit) am only uploading this Public Domain library on GitHub with the 
intention of:
1. Making it available for google and github searches,
2. Adding my own change (syntax only) easily online accessible for the  future,
3. Allowing change requests.

Huge thanks to Matt McCutchen!
